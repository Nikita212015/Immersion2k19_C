## Question of the Week

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

lumberjacks  
background  
downstream  
six-year-old  
The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
