## Question of the Week

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

lumberjacks  
background  
downstream  
six-year-old  
The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

Your code should pass the following test cases

`""`  
`NULL`  
`"isogram"`  
`"eleven"`  
`"zzyzx"`  
`"subdermatoglyphic"`  
`"Alphabet"`  
`"alphAbet"`  
`"thumbscrew-japingly"`  
`"thumbscrew-jappingly"`  
`"six-year-old"`  
`"Emily Jung Schwartzkopf"`  
`"accentor"`  
`"angola"`  

### You may choose to use pre-defined C libraries instead of writing the whole functionality over.
